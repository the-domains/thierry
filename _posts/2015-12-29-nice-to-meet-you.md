###### I'm Thierry De Vynck and I can help you with a creative marketing strategy

Twentysomething. (M)ad Man & always learning.

Hi, my name is Thierry De Vynck and I'm passionate about marketing. I'm currently employed as Inbound Marketing Strategist at Dallas Antwerp -- an independent agency in Antwerp, Belgium that is challenging the current conventions of our industry. I work for both national and international brands and my main role is to assist these brands in perfecting their marketing strategy and translating it into an inbound marketing plan.

Previously, I used to be a member of the GREY EMEA network. As an advertising rookie I had the opportunity to learn from some of the most talented people on this planet. Guided by their skills, methodologies and endless creativity I worked for some of the biggest companies this world has ever seen. So it only seems fair to say that I have seen my share of things in the industry.

#### AndI'm offering all my marketing knowledge to you.

Because I believe there is a huge amount of brands that is left out of the expensive world of advertising. You don't need to spend over â‚¬1,000,000/year to create the perfect marketing strategy.Marketing should be about how your business can improve, rather then the amount of money you are willing to spend.

#### And that's where I come in.

I've decided to dedicate a part of my time helping SME to overcome their marketing challenges. Grow your business with the methodologies and knowledge of the big agencies,without having to pay their big fees.
